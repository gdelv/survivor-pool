        Each pool member chooses one NFL team each week they think will WIN
        their game outright (picks are made 'straight up', not using a point
        spread system).
      </p>
      <p>NFL teams can only be picked once during the season.</p>
      <p>
        If a game your picked team is playing in results in a tie, your pick
        will be correct and your entry will advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final pick deadline each week is Sunday at 1pm ET. If you want to
        pick an earlier game you must do so by kickoff of that game.
